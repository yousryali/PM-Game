    {
      "domain": "Development Approach & Life Cycle",
      "principle": "Tailoring",
      "question": "Your organization typically uses a predictive approach, but your current project has many unknowns. According to PMBOK, what should you do?",
      "options": [
        "Follow the standard predictive approach since it's organizational policy",
        "Request a different project manager with agile experience",
        "Tailor your approach by incorporating adaptive elements appropriate for the project context",
        "Document the risks of using a predictive approach but proceed as usual"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Tailoring principle emphasizes adapting your approach based on context. When a project has many unknowns, incorporating adaptive elements allows for better handling of uncertainty while respecting organizational norms."

    {
      "domain": "Planning",
      "principle": "Value",
      "question": "During project planning, you notice that a deliverable will require significant effort but provides minimal value. What should you do?",
      "options": [
        "Include it anyway since it was in the original scope",
        "Challenge the requirement and suggest alternatives that provide better value",
        "Reduce the quality criteria to minimize effort",
        "Outsource this deliverable to reduce internal costs"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Value principle emphasizes focusing on outcomes that provide meaningful value. Challenging low-value requirements and suggesting alternatives demonstrates a commitment to maximizing project value."
    },
    {
      "domain": "Project Work",
      "principle": "Quality",
      "question": "Your team is under pressure to meet a deadline and suggests skipping some quality checks. What is the best response?",
      "options": [
        "Agree to skip checks for non-critical components only",
        "Extend the deadline to maintain all quality checks",
        "Maintain essential quality processes while finding efficiency improvements",
        "Document the decision to skip quality checks to protect yourself"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Quality principle emphasizes building quality into processes and deliverables. Finding ways to maintain essential quality while improving efficiency upholds this principle better than compromising quality or rigidly refusing to adapt."
    },
    {
      "domain": "Delivery",
      "principle": "Systems Thinking",
      "question": "A project deliverable is ready ahead of schedule, but other dependent components are delayed. What approach best reflects systems thinking?",
      "options": [
        "Deliver the completed component immediately to show progress",
        "Hold the component until all dependent parts are ready for integrated delivery",
        "Deliver the component but mark it as unusable until dependencies are ready",
        "Split the component into smaller parts and deliver what can be used immediately"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Systems Thinking recognizes how components interact within the larger system. Delivering usable portions that provide value while acknowledging dependencies demonstrates this holistic perspective."

    {
      "domain": "Performance",
      "principle": "Measurement",
      "question": "Your project metrics show good progress on deliverables but stakeholder satisfaction is declining. What should you do?",

        "Focus on improving deliverable metrics further since they're objective",
        "Explain to stakeholders why the metrics show the project is actually successful",
        "Reevaluate what value means to stakeholders and adjust your measurements",
        "Add more detailed metrics to provide a more complete picture"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Performance domain emphasizes measuring what matters to stakeholders. When satisfaction declines despite good metrics, reevaluating what constitutes value and adjusting measurements accordingly is essential."
