    {
      "domain": "Development Approach & Life Cycle",
      "principle": "Quality",
      "question": "Your organization typically uses a sequential development approach. How can you best incorporate quality when adopting more iterative methods?",
      "options": [
        "Add a quality phase at the end of each iteration",
        "Maintain the same quality processes used in sequential development",
        "Integrate quality practices throughout the iterative process, including automated testing",
        "Reduce quality requirements to accommodate faster iterations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Quality principle emphasizes building quality into processes and deliverables. Integrating quality practices throughout iterative processes, including automation, ensures quality is maintained while adapting to new development approaches."
    },
    {
      "domain": "Planning",
      "principle": "Change",
      "question": "During planning, how can you best prepare for potential changes?",
      "options": [
        "Create rigid plans to prevent changes",
        "Include change management processes and appropriate reserves in your plans",
        "Avoid detailed planning to accommodate any changes",
        "Plan for the most likely scenario only"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Change principle emphasizes preparing for and embracing change. Including change management processes and appropriate reserves in plans acknowledges that change is inevitable and provides mechanisms to handle it effectively."

    {
      "domain": "Project Work",
      "principle": "Complexity",
      "question": "Your project involves new technology with uncertain implementation requirements. How should you approach this complexity?",
      "options": [
        "Create detailed specifications before beginning implementation",
        "Outsource the technical components to specialists",
        "Use prototyping and iterative development to progressively elaborate requirements",
