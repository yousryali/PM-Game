        "Escalate to their supervisor about their lack of participation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Stakeholders principle emphasizes effective engagement. For high-influence stakeholders, understanding their specific needs and tailoring your engagement approach is more effective than generic communications or escalation."

      "options": [
        "Separate the team members so they don't have to work together",
        "Address the conflict directly in a private setting, focusing on project goals",
        "Ignore the conflict as it will likely resolve itself",
        "Reprimand both team members publicly to set an example"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Leadership principle emphasizes addressing challenges directly while maintaining respect. Addressing conflict privately while refocusing on shared project goals demonstrates effective leadership."

    {
      "domain": "Planning",
      "principle": "Systems Thinking",
      "question": "When planning a new feature that will impact multiple departments, what approach best demonstrates systems thinking?",
      "options": [
        "Focus on technical requirements first, then consider organizational impacts",
        "Plan the feature in isolation to avoid scope creep",
        "Map interdependencies across systems and departments before finalizing plans",
        "Let each department plan their own implementation independently"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Systems Thinking emphasizes understanding how components interact within the larger system. Mapping interdependencies before planning ensures you consider the holistic impact of changes across the organization."

    {
      "domain": "Project Work",
      "principle": "Stewardship",
      "question": "You discover that a shortcut taken by your team could create future maintenance issues after project completion. What demonstrates good stewardship?",
      "options": [
        "Ignore it since it won't affect project delivery metrics",
        "Document it in the project risks but proceed with the shortcut",
        "Address the issue now, even if it requires additional time and resources",
        "Transfer responsibility to the maintenance team"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Stewardship principle emphasizes being a diligent, respectful, and caring steward. Taking responsibility to address issues that could create future problems, even at short-term cost, demonstrates good stewardship."

        "Integrate quality checks throughout the development process",
        "Have the quality assurance team take full responsibility for quality",
        "Focus on meeting the deadline first, then address quality issues"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Quality principle emphasizes building quality into processes and deliverables. Integrating quality checks throughout development prevents defects early rather than discovering them late in the process."

    {
      "domain": "Performance",
      "principle": "Value",
      "question": "Your project is on schedule and within budget, but stakeholders are questioning its value. What should you do?",
