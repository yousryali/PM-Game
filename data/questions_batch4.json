        "Delay the project until market conditions become clearer",
        "Ignore market uncertainties and focus on technical delivery",
        "Build flexibility into the solution to accommodate different market scenarios",
        "Choose the most likely market scenario and optimize for it"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Risk principle emphasizes proactive identification and response to uncertainty. Building flexibility into the solution allows adaptation to different market scenarios rather than committing to a single prediction or delaying action."

        "Implement the change since the stakeholder requested it",
        "Reject the change to protect other departments",
        "Analyze the system-wide impacts and facilitate a holistic decision",
        "Let the departments resolve the conflict themselves"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Systems Thinking emphasizes understanding how components interact within the larger system. Analyzing system-wide impacts and facilitating a holistic decision considers the organization as an interconnected whole rather than isolated departments."

    {
      "domain": "Team",
      "principle": "Quality",
      "question": "Your team is rushing to meet deadlines and starting to take shortcuts. How can you best maintain quality?",
      "options": [
        "Add more quality checks at the end of the process",
        "Accept lower quality to meet deadlines",
        "Integrate quality practices into daily work and adjust expectations if needed",
        "Assign a dedicated quality assurance person to monitor work"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Quality principle emphasizes building quality into processes and deliverables. Integrating quality practices into daily work rather than adding them at the end or compromising on quality is the most effective approach."

    {
      "domain": "Planning",
      "principle": "Complexity",
      "question": "Your project involves multiple interdependent workstreams with uncertain requirements. How should you approach planning?",
